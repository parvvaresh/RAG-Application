## Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a hybrid approach that integrates the strengths of both retrieval-based and generative models. The retrieval component fetches relevant documents or passages from a knowledge base, while the generative component synthesizes the information to produce a coherent and contextually appropriate response.


## Features

- **Retrieval Component**: Efficiently retrieves relevant documents or passages from a knowledge base.
- **Generative Component**: Generates coherent and contextually appropriate responses based on retrieved information.
- **Customizable Knowledge Base**: Easily integrate your own knowledge base or dataset.
- **Scalable**: Designed to handle large-scale datasets and high query volumes.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive API for easy integration into existing systems.

## Installation

To get started with the RAG application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/parvvaresh/RAG-Application.git
   cd RAG-Application
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up the knowledge base**:
   - Place your documents or passages in the `knowledge_base/` directory.
   - Update the configuration file to point to your knowledge base.

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
